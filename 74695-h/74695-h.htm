</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">F</span>OR a hundred years the old
House has been weathering
the mountain storms or basking
in the lovely Virginia
sunshine, proud of the fact
that its red bricks were made
on the place, from the red clay
which lies so plentiful all about it,
coloring the hilltops and making
the roads look like red ribbons
tying the mountains to the valleys.
The blinds, great green eyelids,
reflect the life of the inmates, in the
morning spreading wide in a spirit of
up-and-about-ness, during the afternoon
nap time drowsily shutting in the cool
rooms, at sundown opening again for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
afternoon tea and visiting hour. The
whole House, with its air of quiet dignity
and breeding, seems to say: “Why rush
or hurry? There is time for all.”</p>

<p>Bless its old heart, if we could
count years as it can, we too might
be peaceful and restful. But our lives
are so short, we come and go so fast,
no wonder at times the old House seems
looking down on us with sadness; for
surely the graveyard in the meadow near
by tells the story of man’s short existence.
The happy, merry people whose
voices once made the walls of the old
House ring rest there under the myrtle
and boxwood, watched over by the
nightingale and whip-poor-will. The
old headstones, moss and ivy covered,
lean down toward their dead lovingly,
as though wishing to get nearer to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>But what must the old House think,
now that it has telephones on each
floor, and flaring gas where soft candlelight
used to flicker, making exaggerated
shadows on the low ceilings. And
horror of horrors, a rushing, snorting
whirlwind of an automobile rushes up
to the old horse block! Ghosts of
horsemen can fairly be seen riding
hurriedly in every direction, indignant
at such intrusion, while the red brick
walk, with its border of boxwood,
scorns the noisy intruder with its brass
lamps all a-shining, and tells of the
days when the stately coach with its
load of pretty maids and matrons all
a-flutter passed by on its weekly trip
to town. Now with this new, swiftly-moving,
malodorous machine, the trip
is made daily, and who can say if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
maids be pretty or not, so much like
animated sacks of wool do they look
in their cloaks, hoods, and goggles.</p>

<p>It is in the evening, when the crescent
moon hangs low, that the old
House talks to the oaks, living over
the days when it held its first young
couple, rejoicing with them at the stork’s
coming, caring for the little ones as they
toddle about the great white-pillared
porches, which shade them from too
much sun, watching them grow into
manhood and womanhood, and finally
sending the sons to war with pride and
high hope, though deploring the cruel
and unnecessary strife between brothers
that should have been settled without
bloodshed. Because of the spirit of
dissension still harbored in the hearts
of our people, for many years the South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
has been crippled and disheartened and
North and South have been divided.
Time alone can heal these differences and
make us one again.</p>

<p>This the old House foresaw, and it
opened wide its portals to welcome
a Northern family. Being all-wise, it
knew that all men are brothers and that
between them, God’s finest handiwork,
there should be no dissension. This
should be left for the dwellers of the
under-worlds, that are not so high on
the ladder of life as is man.</p>

<p>Never does the old House hold its
head quite so high as when the pink-coated
horsemen gather with their
hounds and thoroughbreds for a cross-country
run. Returning to the hunt
breakfast, they are greeted with the
hospitable groaning of the table laden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
with the weight of its goodies—great
Virginia hams, freshly roasted and melting
under the knife; the Brunswick stew,
for which the housewife has been preparing
many days, sending negroes to hunt
squirrels and to select the special corn
and tomatoes that go to the making of
the world’s best breakfast dish; and from
the kitchen at the end of the gallery,
steaming hot beaten biscuits to be eaten
with gold-sweet butter. The mint juleps
are drunk beside crackling fires, and
“sport” and “good cheer” are the watchwords.
The old House looks down
approvingly on the happy company, for
it has come into its own, sheltering in
these later days kind, cheery people
that respect its past glories and love its
present homelike spirit, for to them
its every stick and stone spell Home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>We drink your health, dear old House.
May the future hold as much for you as
the past. May you continue to sleep
peacefully under the oaks, dreaming
happy dreams, and understanding life
as only one of your great age can.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/image021.jpg" width="75" alt="I">
</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span> LOOK up from my book and
the cool corner of the veranda,
conscious of a very busy, noisy
life in the great boxwood trees
at either side of the brick walk.
For many bird families live
among the comfortable, shady
branches; and I am reminded of a
tenement house in the East End,
as all the bird families are large and the
making of their living is uppermost in
their little heads.</p>

<p>The robins have the top flat, the
thrushes the first floor up, and the noisy
catbirds the ground floor. If by any
chance Father Robin enters the Thrush
apartment, there is a dreadful fuss. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
families in the other flats all take a hand
in reproving the gentleman for his carelessness,
and it takes many minutes ere
all is peaceful and quiet again.</p>

<p>The green opening or door of the
robin flat is large and much worn, for
the husky baby robins eat their weight
in worms each day, and keep their loving
parents more than busy coming and
going with their bills full of goodies.
The catbird has time to sit on his doorstep
and sing to his little wife in modest
gown of Quaker gray, encouraging her
to stay on her nest. He himself darts
off only to return with a titbit in the
shape of a fat fly for her enjoyment.
The thrush family are very well behaved,
minding their own business, but always
keeping a jealous eye upon Minnie, my
Scotch terrier. Whenever she walks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
across the lawn in the direction of the
flats, they dart down in front of her nose
with a cry half of fear and half of play.
They always fly away from the nest,
flopping on the ground as if hurt, to
attract the dog’s attention, and leading
her by stratagem to the farther end of the
garden. Then, with a tantalizing chirp,
they fly back to their nest.</p>

<p>When the shadows grow long, the
proud parents take the little ones out for
a lesson in flying. How patient they are
with the clumsy fluff-balls that cling
to the lower branches and squeal, fearing
to let go and trust the half-grown wings.
The parents, in a near-by tree, coax and
shame them into trying, until they drop
off one limb and flop feebly to the next.
This is the hour my dog is locked up, for
otherwise great would be the tragedy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the little fluff-balls are so very helpless.</p>

<p>I am certain the mother and father
birds know I take this precaution, for
they repay me in song, and become
exceedingly tame, allowing me to peep
into their nests without fear, and answering
my call as would a trained canary.
Often they fly down near my head and
accompany me on my walk through the
garden. Their little beady eyes notice
my every motion, and they show off by
bullying and chasing the hedge sparrows
we meet in our walk, seeming to say:
“Get out of our way, you disrespectful
birds. Don’t you see the Mistress out
for a walk?” The poor little hedge
sparrows hurry and scurry to the nearest
tree, cocking their tiny heads to one side,
as if saying: “Why all this excitement?
She’s not so much!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>The Japanese mimosa tree is in blossom
and so is the trumpet vine, both of
which attract the humming bird in his
coat of many colors. His beautiful wings,
with their rapid motion, glisten in the
sunlight like miniature rainbows. When
you are favored with a peep into his
nest, you think it a strange place to
keep quinine pills, for the resemblance
between these and the little eggs is very
striking, both having the same shape,
size, and color. I dislike to think of this
lovely dream-like bird as one of the most
bloodthirsty of the feathered tribe, but a
fight between two humming birds always
means death to one, for their long bills
are as sharp as darning needles, and they
are expert fencers.</p>

<p>Idling in my easy chair, I listen to the
love-making of a pair of doves that live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
high up in the tree at the end of the
veranda. They never seem to tire of
love or the telling of it. They are so
busy making love that they have not
had time to build a substantial nest, and
after each storm I look with fear at their
loosely put together home. Love, it is
said, makes the world go round, and it
must likewise be love that keeps the
doves’ nest in the tree, for there seems
to be nothing else that is doing so.</p>

<p>The early evening is the swallows’
play time. They dart and chase one
another around the house top, fairly
shrieking with delight. And when the
moon rises, the plaintive call of the whip-poor-will
comes up from the glen. He is
a solitary fellow, never coming near the
house, although I feel he serves with
the nightingale as a night watchman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>I find myself growing sleepy, and as I
glance over to the Boxwood Flats, it is
apparent that for hours the occupants
have been asleep, dreaming of the early
worm and of the happy sunshine that
to-morrow holds for them.</p>

<p>Good night, my friends. May there
be another day for us to meet and enjoy
ourselves. We are all a part of the great
scheme, each a cog in the wheel of
Destiny. Man is prying into the secrets
of your lives and habits, endeavoring
to solve the mystery of your migratory
flight. Where did you obtain the knowledge
of the compass which enables you,
after a journey of hundreds of miles, to
find the very tree that last year held your
nest? And where do you keep the speed
that makes it possible for you to travel a
mile a minute? Can it be you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
found an air current that encircles the
globe, carrying you to any part of the
earth you desire to reach? Thus far you
have guarded well your secret from the
naturalists.</p>

<p>Mayhap, my Boxwood Flatters, you
will confide in me, if I promise not to
raise your rent.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span> AM only a horse but if men
could understand all the joy
of being a thoroughbred with
a record of 1:21, they would
not say so pityingly that
horses have almost human intelligence,
for in possessing horse
sense we have a gift that is
just as great.</p>

<p>The first years of my colthood were
spent under a trainer’s eye. As the
months passed, he developed in my growing
limbs the speed that was my birthright.
Coming as I do from a long line
of aristocrats, my name was entered
early for the Great American Derby.
When that day came, my heart was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
full of the spirit of the race, I surprised
myself as well as my trainers. Then
followed three years of a hard professional
career, all that time being spent
on the flat and on the steeplechase track.
I traveled from city to city, making
and breaking records, until my health
failed, and I was sold to a kindly gentleman
who rode me in the city parks. It
was humiliating at times to have to run
with the ordinary park hacks one meets
on the bridle paths; but for my master’s
sake, for my master was always good to
me, I would hold back and try to make
it “sporty” coming in at the finish.</p>

<p>One day my feet fairly danced with
joy, for again I was to be trained for a
real race to be held at one of the country
clubs. My trainer and I would go to the
parks early, before the police were on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
duty, for they didn’t seem to know the
difference between a sporty run and a
flighty-headed runaway. My legs were
bandaged to keep them in condition
under the extraordinary work and strain,
and as I looked back over my flanks, they
seemed daily to grow in muscle and
shapeliness with the vigorous exercise.
Each muscle and nerve quivered, anxious
to show what it was capable of doing.</p>

<p>At last the long looked for day came.
The grand stand was full of people,
and as my master patted my neck and
smoothed down my slender legs, picking
up each hoof to look into it for trouble,
he whispered into my ear, “Good luck,
Bar-Gee, old boy! Go in and win, and
show them what a good horse can do.”</p>

<p>I found it hard to keep all four feet
on the ground at once, my heart was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
light and happy, and I fear I gave some
little trouble at the post, the old plugs
were so slow in coming up. My racing
blood urged me to be off. Every drop
of it was dancing and crying for the
sport. At last the starting wire flew up,
and we were off. I stretched myself
very close to the ground, making no
false moves, and the earth danced away
under my flying feet. My jockey clung
to the snaffle and never used the whip.
I could hear the other horses coming
after me, breathing and snorting, their
jockeys all using whips and spurs. By
this time I had but one thought—to keep
in the lead and to win, win, win! As we
turned the half-mile post my jockey put
his whip on me. This angered me, for I
was only waiting to come a little nearer
the field so the finish would be more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
brilliant before my master. I knew he
had sugar in his pocket. We pulled into
the home stretch, and my hoofs fairly
sang on the turf. The people in the
grand stand jumped to their feet and
cheered as I came under the wire just
twenty feet ahead of second. It took
me a quarter of a mile beyond that to
stop, for once my instinct for racing
was aroused, the blood of my ancestors
asserted itself, and I hated knowing it
was all over.</p>

<p>Wreaths of flowers were hung around
my neck, and I was walked up and down
in front of the judges and the grand stand.
I wanted so to get to my master and talk
it all over with him, with my nose in his
loving hand. I was so glad I had won
the big silver cup I even allowed his
women folk to talk baby talk to me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
which is, of course, foolish—and besides,
I hadn’t forgotten the sugar.</p>

<p>During that autumn I was shipped
down to my master’s estate in Virginia,
where the horses are all trained for fox
hunting and not for speed. I enjoyed a
few runs, but the hunters do not know
what this sport is; their game evidently
is not to see how fast they can go or how
high they can jump, but how close they
can keep to the dogs without stepping on
them. It always makes me angry to be
held in, so I do not make good as a hunter.
Moreover, I have developed a cough,
which makes it hard for me to breathe,
and being infectious, compels me to
spend my days alone in an open field.</p>

<p>I frequently have friendly chats over
the fence with the other horses, but it
is unsafe to have us together. I must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
confess my heart is sad when my master
rides by on his big hunter. I hate that
horse, and if my heels could reach him,
he would not put on such airs and lord it
over me. Of course I am not jealous, for I
know my master loves me, and I often
hear him giving orders for my comfort;
but I am never taken out now. My
cough is growing worse, and I feel I am
getting old.</p>

<p>One night there was great excitement
because a drunken negro had stolen me
and sold me for twelve dollars. Think of
the indignity! My blue-blooded ancestors
must have turned in their graves or stood
on their hind legs with indignation if
they knew it. I was taken many miles
away and shut up in a lot surrounded by
a five-rail fence. When I was left alone,
I jumped the fence and started for home.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
The going was hard, as I was impatient
to get home again, and my cough had
made me feeble. I wanted so to stop and
rest by the cool roadside where the grass
looked fresh and green, but I did not
dare, for I knew I should be missed. At
last I saw the Blue Ridge Farm stables.
How good they looked to me! I had just
strength enough to whinny to my friends
in the paddock as I trotted into the
stable, tired, but happy and contented.</p>

<p>Now I am living on the best of the
land, and as I rest under the big chestnut
tree in the paddock, my thoughts
run back to the days when my jockey
slept in my stall to keep me safe from
foul play. I see myself, blanketed,
ready to appear before the judges, and
impatiently waiting while my jockey
is weighing in. The grand stand is gay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
with music and flags. The light saddle
is tossed across my back. A race is
before me. Ah! those were the happiest
moments of my life.</p>

<p>The races are all run now—all but
one, and that will be the run over to
the Happy Hunting Ground. I hope
when the last wire flies up, I shall be
brave and full of hope, and go in as a
thoroughbred should.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">S</span>TRADIVARIUS was at work
in his dingy workshop, putting
his very heart into the violin
he was making. The wood
had come from the North and
was well seasoned. It seemed
to throb and pulsate with life
under his hands, reflecting and
answering every sound that
floated in through the open
window. When the violin was finished,
Stradivarius placed the instrument in its
oil bath as tenderly as a young mother
bathes her new-born babe. The red-brown
varnish spread on smoothly,
filling every pore of the wood without
stiffening the vibrations that were to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
sound through the world for centuries,
and under loving fingers tell in a volume
of tone the heart story of each successive
owner of the violin.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Here I have been for years, hanging
in my green bag from a rusty nail in the
attic, forgotten and neglected by man,
my only friends and companions the
fairies that come and dance in the moonlight
on the attic floor. It was they who
told me of the happy bride that awaited
her bridegroom’s coming in the quiet old
house beneath me. One day I was taken
out into the sunshine and told I was to
play at her wedding. I put my best into
the tones that greeted the bride when
she entered the church, and I think tears
of happiness fell as she passed along
the dim, cool aisle to meet her lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>The old church chimed out its wedding
bells, and my sides nearly burst
with joy sending back the merry sounds.
That night I had much to tell the fairies,
for again I was in my green bag on my
rusty nail in the peaceful, musty attic.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Again, after many years, I have been
awakened. A sad-faced old lady took
me out of my bag and put me into the
hands of a youth, saying: “This, my son,
is the violin that was played at my wedding.”
I breathed a sigh of gratitude,
for his touch was a caress, and I saw the
soul of my old master looking through
his eyes. And joy of joys, when he
pulled his bow across my strings, I sent
up a prayer of thankfulness that we were
together again. My dear, dear master
that created me and made me laugh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
when he was merry, and cry when he
was sad! All the long years of waiting
were forgotten as the youth tucked me
under his arm and descended the creaky
old stairs. Never again shall I be neglected,
but shall live in light and sunshine,
vibrating happiness in this world, and
foretelling the wonders and beauties of
the world to come, where there are no
green bags, no rusty nails or long, tiresome
intervals of waiting for my master’s
hand to play upon my finger board and
make my sounding posts dance with joy.</p>

<p>My master’s soul told me of his
journeys to other planets, and of his
longing to return to earth to fulfill all
his dreams and do the good he had
left undone, and how with my help he
now hoped to reach the heart of man.
Together we would inspire the youth to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
play the songs of love and happiness, and
the plaintive song of sorrow that would
show the way to the higher life, to the
soul, to God.</p>

<p>Thus we journey together on the
crest of melody’s wave, reaching the
highest as well as the most lowly, for
where is the soul dumb to the language
of music, and not the better for the
understanding of it? We have borrowed
the youth’s hand and heart to express
a message from another world, bringing
hope to the hopeless, love to the lonely,
and peace and quiet to the restless.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">M</span>ANY thousand years ago two
goldfish lived in the fountain
of an Indian princess. The
marble court was a mass of
color with its great pots of
marigolds bathed in sunshine.
Lord and Lady Goldfish had
everything they could wish for.
Their carved alabaster basin-home
was known far and wide
in birdland, for nowhere could
one get such a gloriously cool bath
in the early dawn as in the courtyard
with its pavement of many-colored
marbles. But, with all this, His Lordship
had discontent and envy in his heart.
He envied the birds their flight through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
the air. He envied the Princess her
green jade bracelets, that reflected the
sun, the sky, and the water, and so spent
his hours in a state of unrest. But his
little wife lived her life happily content,
performing all her duties and fulfilling
her destiny as ordained, and at the end
passing on to a higher stage, working
that out, then passing on to higher and
still higher stages, until at last she
became a human soul in the form of a
happy little child.</p>

<p>One day the child was taken very
ill, and this brought sadness to many
hearts. Her illness was long and painful
and made her too weak for play, so
for hours she lay watching a pretty
goldfish swimming in his bowl. During
the long, dreary days and nights His
Lordship (for it was none other) told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
her of his presence, and repented of
his discontent and envy, for it kept him
always in the same stage. He never
improved or advanced, but each reincarnation
came back to learn the same
lesson.</p>

<p>One long night, as the little child lay
wakeful, full of pain and suffering, she
remembered him. Away back in her
mind she saw the Indian garden and the
slender, dusky Princess in her dainty
robes and tinkling silver anklets, the
happy birds, the marigolds, and the
china-blue sky. Her heart was filled
with pity for His Lordship, and during
the still of the night her beautiful white
soul imparted to him a knowledge of the
folly of his ways, and pointed out the
path of progress to happiness. When
morning came, it brought peace to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
pain-racked body, for the soul had flown
to a higher and better world. And as
the morning sun flooded the room with
its golden light, a kindly ray fell on His
Lordship floating on the surface of the
water, his pretty tail and fins all limp.
He too had passed on, making his first
upward advance in the long chain of
lives toward the perfect soul that was
awaiting him.</p>
